DESCRIPTION
===========


check_pgactivity is designed to monitor PostgreSQL clusters from Nagios. It
offers many options to measure and monitor useful performance metrics.


\ **-s**\ , \ **--service**\  SERVICE
 
 The nagios service to run. See section SERVICES for a description of available
 services or use \ ``--list``\  for a short service and description list.
 


\ **-h**\ , \ **--host**\  HOST
 
 Database server host or socket directory (default: "localhost").
 


\ **-U**\ , \ **--username**\  ROLE
 
 Database user name (default: "postgres").
 


\ **-p**\ , \ **--port**\  PORT
 
 Database server port (default: "5432").
 


\ **-d**\ , \ **--dbname**\  DATABASE
 
 Database name to connect to (default: "postgres").
 


\ **-S**\ , \ **--dbservice**\  SERVICE_NAME
 
 The connection service name from pg_service.conf.
 


\ **-w**\ , \ **--warning**\  THRESHOLD
 
 The Warning threshold.
 


\ **-c**\ , \ **--critical**\  THRESHOLD
 
 The Critical threshold.
 


\ **--tmpdir**\  DIRECTORY
 
 Path to a directory where the script can create temporary files. The
 script relies on the system default temporary directory if possible.
 


\ **-P**\ , \ **--psql**\  FILE
 
 Path to the \ ``psql``\  executable (default: "psql").
 


\ **--status-file**\  PATH
 
 PATH to the file where service status information will be kept between successive
 calls. Default to check_pgactivity.data in the same directory of the script.
 


\ **-t**\ , \ **--timeout**\  TIMEOUT
 
 Timeout to use (default: "30s"). It can be specified as raw (in seconds) or as
 an interval. This timeout will be used as *statement_timeout* for psql and URL
 timeout for the *minor_version* service.
 


\ **--list**\ 
 
 List available services.
 


\ **-V**\ , \ **--version**\ 
 
 Print version and exit.
 


\ **--debug**\ 
 
 Print some debug messages.
 


\ **-?**\ , \ **--help**\ 
 
 Show this help page.
 



THRESHOLDS
==========


THRESHOLD emitted as warning or critical values can be a raw number, a
percentage, an interval, or a size. Each available service supports one or more
formats (eg. a size and a percentage).


\ **Percentage**\ 
 
 If threshold is a percentage, the value should end with a '%' (no spaces).
 For example: 95%.
 


\ **Interval**\ 
 
 If THRESHOLD is an interval, the following units are accepted (not case
 sensitive): s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than
 one unit per given value. If not set, the last unit is in seconds.
 For example: "1h 55m 6" = "1h55m6s".
 


\ **Size**\  If THRESHOLD is a size, the following units are accepted (not case sensitive):
b (Byte), k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), t (TB), p (PB), e (EB) or Z (ZB). Only
integers are accepted. Eg. \ ``1.5MB``\  will be refused, use \ ``1500kB``\ .
 
 The factor between units is 1024 Bytes. Eg. \ ``1g = 1G = 1024\*1024\*1024.``\ 
 



CONNECTIONS
==========


check_pgactivity allows two different connection specifications: by service, or
by specifying values for host, user, port, and database. Moreover, some services
can run on multiple hosts, or can connect to multiple hosts.

You must specify one of the parameters below if the service needs to connect
to your PostgreSQL instance. check_pgactivity will NOT look for
the *libpq* environment variables.

The format for connection parameters is:


\ **Parameter**\  \ ``--dbservice SERVICE_NAME``\ 
 
 Define a new host using the given service. Multiple hosts can be defined by
 listing multiple services separated by a comma. Eg.
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --dbservice service1,service2
 
 


\ **Parameters**\  \ ``--host HOST``\ , \ ``--port PORT``\ , \ ``--user ROLE``\  or \ ``--dbname DATABASE``\ 
 
 One of these parameters is enough to define a new host. If some
 parameters are missing, default values are used.
 
 If multiple values are given, define as many host as maximum given values.
 
 Values are associated by position. Eg.:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --host h1,h2 --port 5432,5433
 
 
 Means "host=h1 port=5432" and "host=h2 port=5433".
 
 If the number of values is different between parameters, any host missing a
 parameter will use the first given value for this parameter. Eg.:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --host h1,h2 --port 5433
 
 
 Means: "host=h1 port=5433" and "host=h2 port=5433".
 


\ **Services are defined first**\ 
 
 For example:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --dbservice s1 --host h1 --port 5433
 
 
 Means use "service=s1" and "host=h1 port=5433" in this order. If the service
 supports only one host, the second is ignored.
 


\ **Mutual exclusion between both methods**\ 
 
 You can not overwrite service connection variables with parameters \ ``--host HOST``\ , \ ``--port PORT``\ , \ ``--user ROLE``\  or \ ``--dbname DATABASE``\ 
 



SERVICES
========


Descriptions and parameters of available services.


\ **autovacuum**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the autovacuum activity on the cluster.
 
 Perfdata contains the age of oldest autovacuum and the number of workers by type
 (VACUUM, VACUUM ANALYZE, ANALYZE, VACUUM FREEZE).
 
 Thresholds, if any, are ignored.
 


\ **backends**\  (all)
 
 Check the total number of connections in the PostgreSQL cluster.
 
 Perfdata contains the number of connections per database.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number or a percentage (eg.
 80%). When a threshold is a percentage, it is compared to the cluster parameter
 \ ``max_connections``\ .
 


\ **backends_status**\  (8.2+)
 
 Check status of all backends (databases). Depending on your PostgreSQL
 version, statuses are: *idle*, *idle in transaction*, *idle in transaction (aborted)*
 (>=9.0 only), *fastpath function call*, *active*, *waiting for lock*, *undefined*,
 *disabled*, and *insufficient privilege*. "insufficient privilege" appears when you are not
 allowed to see the statuses of other connections.
 
 This service supports the argument \ ``--exclude REGEX``\  to exclude queries
 matching the given regular expression from the check. You can use multiple
 \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ .
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept a list of
 'status_label=value' separated by a comma. Available labels are *idle*, *idle_xact*,
 *aborted_xact*, *fastpath*, *active*, and *waiting*. Values are raw numbers, and empty
 lists are forbidden. Here is an example:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
      -w 'waiting=5,idle_xact=10' -c 'waiting=20,idle_xact=30'
 
 
 Perfdata contains the number of backends for each status and the oldest one for
 each of them, for 8.2+.
 
 Note that the number of backends reported in the Nagios message \ **includes**\ 
 excluded backend.
 


\ **database_size**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the variation of database sizes.
 
 This service uses the status file (see \ ``--status-file``\  parameter).
 
 Perfdata contains the size difference for each database since the last execution.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number, a percentage, or a
 size (eg. 2.5G).
 


\ **wal_files**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the number of WAL files.
 
 Perfdata returns the total number of WAL files, current number of written WALs,
 the current number of recycled WALs and the rate of WAL written to disk since
 last execution on master clusters.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number of files, or a
 percentage. In case of percentage, the limit is computed based on:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * (2 + checkpoint_completion_target)
 
 
 For PostgreSQL 8.1 and 8.2:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * 2
 
 
 If \ ``wal_keep_segments``\  is set for 9.0 and above, the limit is the greatest
 of the following formulas :
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * (2 + checkpoint_completion_target)
    100% = 1 + wal_keep_segments + 2 * checkpoint_segments
 
 


\ **ready_archives**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the number of WAL files ready to archive.
 
 Perfdata returns the number of WAL files waiting to be archived.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept a raw number of files.
 


\ **last_analyze**\  (8.2+)
 
 Check on each databases that the oldest analyze (from autovacuum or not) is not
 older than the given threshold.
 
 This service uses the status file (see \ ``--status-file``\  parameter) with
 PostgreSQL 9.1+.
 
 Perfdata returns oldest "analyze" per database in seconds. With PostgreSQL
 9.1+, the number of [auto]analyzes per database since last execution is also returned.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s)
 and apply to the oldest execution of analyze.
 


\ **last_vacuum**\  (8.2+)
 
 Check that the oldest vacuum (from autovacuum or otherwise) in each database in the cluster is not
 older than the given threshold.
 
 This service uses the status file (see \ ``--status-file``\  parameter) with
 PostgreSQL 9.1+.
 
 Perfdata returns oldest vacuum per database in seconds. With PostgreSQL
 9.1+, it also returns the number of [auto]vacuums per database since last
 execution.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s)
 and apply to the oldest vacuum.
 


\ **locks**\  (all)
 
 Check the number of locks on the hosts.
 
 Perfdata returns the number of locks, by type.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number of locks or a
 percentage. For percentage, it is computed using the following:
 
 for 7.4 to 8.1:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    max_locks_per_transaction * max_connections
 
 
 for 8.2+:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)
 
 


\ **bgwriter**\  (8.3+)
 
 Check the percentage of pages written by backends since last check.
 
 This service uses the status file (see \ ``--status-file``\  parameter).
 
 Perfdata contains the difference from the pg_catalog.pg_stat_bgwriter counters since last
 execution.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. If set, they *only* accept a
 percentage.
 


\ **archive_folder**\ 
 
 Check if all archived WALs exist between the oldest and the latest WAL in the
 archive folder and make sure they are 16MB. The given folder must have archived
 files from ONE cluster. The version of PostgreSQL that created the archives is
 only checked on the last one (for performance reasons).
 
 This service requires the argument \ ``--path``\  on the command line to specify the
 archive folder path to check.
 
 Optional argument \ ``--ignore-wal-size``\  skips the WAL size check. This is useful if your
 archived WALs are compressed. Default behaviour is to check the WAL size.
 
 Optional argument \ ``--suffix``\  allows you define the prefix of your archived
 WALs. Useful if they are compressed with an extension (eg. .gz, .bz2, ...).
 Default is no suffix.
 
 Perfdata contains the number of WALs archived and the age of the most recent one.
 
 Critical and Warning define the max age of the latest archived WAL as an
 interval (eg. 5m or 300s ).
 


\ **minor_version**\  (all)
 
 Check if the cluster is running the most recent minor version of PostgreSQL.
 
 Latest version of PostgreSQL can be fetched from PostgreSQL official
 website if check_pgactivity can access it or it is given as a parameter.
 
 Without \ ``--critical``\  or \ ``--warning``\  parameters, this service attempts
 to fetch the latest version online. You can optionally set the path to
 your prefered program using the parameter \ ``--path``\  (eg.
 \ ``--path '/usr/bin/wget'``\ ). Supported programs are: GET, wget, curl,
 fetch, lynx, links, links2.
 
 For the online version, a critical alert is raised if the minor version is not
 the most recent.
 
 If you do not want to (or cannot) query the PostgreSQL website, you
 must provide the expected version using either \ ``--warning``\  OR
 \ ``--critical``\ . The given format must be one or more MINOR versions
 separated by anything other than a '.'. Eg. the following parameters are all
 equally valid:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --critical "9.3.2 9.2.6 9.1.11 9.0.15 8.4.19"
    --critical "9.3.2, 9.2.6, 9.1.11, 9.0.15, 8.4.19"
    --critical 9.3.2,9.2.6,9.1.11,9.0.15,8.4.19
    --critical 9.3.2/9.2.6/9.1.11/9.0.15/8.4.19
 
 
 Any version other than 3 numbers separated by dots will be ignored.
 if the running PostgreSQL major version is not found, the service raises an
 unknown status.
 
 Using the offline version raises either a critical or a warning depending
 on which has been set.
 
 Perfdata returns the numerical version of PostgreSQL.
 


\ **hot_standby_delta**\  (9.0)
 
 Check the data delta between a cluster and its Hot standbys.
 
 You must give the connection parameters for two or more clusters.
 
 Perfdata returns the data delta in bytes between the master and each Hot
 standby listed.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds can take one or two values separated by a
 comma. If only one value given, it applies to both received and replayed data.
 If two values are given, the first one applies to received data, the second one to
 replayed data. These thresholds only accept a size (eg. 2.5G).
 
 This service raises a Critical if it doesn't find exactly ONE valid master cluster
 (ie. critical when 0 or 2 and more masters).
 


\ **streaming_delta**\  (9.1+)
 
 Check the data delta between a cluster and its standbys in Streaming Replication.
 
 Optional argument \ ``--slave``\  allows you to specify some slaves that MUST be
 connected. This argument can be used as many times as desired to check multiple
 slave connections, or you can specify multiple slaves connections at one time
 using comma separated values. Both methods can be used in a single call. The
 given value must be of the form "APPLICATION_NAME IP".
 Either of the following examples will check for the presence of two slaves:
 
 
 .. code-block:: perl
 
    --slave 'slave1 192.168.1.11' --slave 'slave2 192.168.1.12'
    --slave 'slave1 192.168.1.11','slave2 192.168.1.12'
 
 
 Perfdata returns the data delta in bytes between the master and all standbys
 found and the number of slaves connected.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds can take one or two values separated by a
 comma. If only one value is supplied, it applies to both flushed and replayed data.
 If two values are supplied, the first one applies to flushed data, the second one to
 replayed data. These thresholds only accept a size (eg. 2.5G).
 


\ **hit_ratio**\  (all)
 
 Check the cache hit ratio on the cluster.
 
 Perfdata contains the cache hit ratio per database. Template databases and
 databases that do not allow connections will not be checked, nor will
 databases which have never been used.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They only accept a percentage.
 


\ **backup_label_age**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the age of the backup label file.
 
 Perfdata returns the age of the backup_label file, -1 if not present.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s).
 


\ **oldest_2pc**\  (8.1+)
 
 Check the oldest two phase commit transaction (aka. prepared transaction) in
 the cluster.
 
 Perfdata contains the max/avg age time and the number of prepared
 transaction per databases.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.
 


\ **oldest_xact**\  (8.3+)
 
 Check the oldest *idle* transaction.
 
 Perfdata contains the max/avg age and the number of idle
 transactions per database.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.
 


\ **longest_query**\  (all)
 
 Check the longest running query in the cluster. This service supports argument
 \ ``--exclude REGEX``\  to exclude queries matching the given regular expression from the check.
 You can give multiple \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ .
 
 Perfdata contains the max/avg/min running time and the number of queries per
 database.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.
 


\ **connection**\  (all)
 
 Perform a simple connection test.
 
 No perfdata is returned.
 
 This service ignores critical and warning arguments.
 


\ **custom_query**\  (all)
 
 Execute the given user query.
 
 The query is specified with the \ ``--query parameter``\ . The first column will be
 used to perform the test for the status if warning and critical are provided.
 
 The warning and critical arguments are optional. They can be of format integer
 (default), size, or time depending on the \ ``--type``\  argument. Warning and Critical
 will be raised if they are greater than the first column, or less if the
 \ ``--reverse``\  option is used.
 
 All other columns will be used to generate the perfdata. The query must
 display them in the perfdata format, with unit if required (eg. "size=35B").
 If a field contains multiple values, they must be separated by a space.
 


\ **configuration**\  (8.0+)
 
 Check the most important settings.
 
 Warning and Critical tresholds are ignored.
 
 Specific parameters are :
 \ ``--work_mem``\ , \ ``--maintenance_work_mem``\ , \ ``--shared_buffers``\ ,\ ``-- wal_buffers``\ ,
 \ ``--checkpoint_segments``\ , \ ``--effective_cache_size``\ , \ ``--no_check_autovacuum``\ ,
 \ ``--no_check_fsync``\ , \ ``--no_check_enable``\ , \ ``--no_check_track_counts``\ .
 


\ **max_freeze_age**\  (all)
 
 Checks oldest database by transaction age.
 
 Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept either a raw number
 or percentage for PostgreSQL 8.2 and more. If percentage is given, the
 thresholds are computed based on the "autovacuum_freeze_max_age" parameter.
 100% means some table(s) reached the maximum age and will trigger an autovacuum
 freeze. Percentage thresholds should therefore be greater than 100%.
 
 Even with no threshold, this service will raise a critical alert if one database
 has a negative age.
 
 Perfdata returns the age of each database.
 


\ **is_master**\  (all)
 
 Checks if the cluster accepts read and/or write queries. This state is reported
 as "in production" by pg_controldata.
 
 This service ignores critical and warning arguments.
 
 No perfdata is returned.
 


\ **is_hot_standby**\  (9.0+)
 
 Checks if the cluster is in recovery mode and accepts read only queries.
 
 This service ignores critical and warning arguments.
 
 No perfdata is returned.
 


\ **pga_version**\ 
 
 Checks if this script is running the given version of check_pgactivity.
 You must provide the expected version using either \ ``--warning``\  OR
 \ ``--critical``\ .
 
 No perfdata is returned.
 


\ **is_replay_paused**\  (9.1+)
 
 Checks if replication is paused. The service will return UNKNOWN if executed
 against a master cluster
 
 Thresholds are optional. They must be specified as interval. OK will always be returned if
 the standby is not paused, even if replication delta time hits the thresholds.
 
 Critical or warning are raised if last reported replayed timestamp is greater than given
 threshold AND some data received from the master are not applied yet. OK will always be
 returned if the standby is paused, or if the standby has already replayed everything from master and until some
 write activity happens on the master.
 
 Perfdata returned :
   \* paused status (0 no, 1 yes, NaN if master)
   \* lag time (in second)
   \* data delta with master (0 no, 1 yes)
 


\ **btree_bloat**\ 
 
 Estimate bloat on B-tree indexes.
 
 Warning and critical thresholds accept a comma-separated list of either
 raw number(for a size), size (eg. 125M), or percentage. The thresholds apply to
 *bloat* size, not object size. If a percentage is given, the threshold will apply
 to the bloat size compared to the total index size. If multiple threshold
 values are passed, check_pgactivity will choose the largest (bloat size) value.
 
 This service supports argument a \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ parameter to exclude relation matching
 the regular expression. The regular expression applies to
 "schema_name.relation_name". You can use multiple \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ parameters.
 
 **Warning**: With a non-superuser role, only indexes on the table the role is granted access to
 are checked!
 
 Perfdata will return the number of indexes of concern, by warning and critical
 threshold per database.
 


\ **table_bloat**\ 
 
 Estimate bloat on tables.
 
 Warning and critical thresholds accept a comma-separated list of either
 raw number (for a size), size (eg. 125M), or percentage. The thresholds apply to
 *bloat* size, not object size. If a percentage is given, the threshold will apply
 to the bloat size compared to the table + TOAST size. If multiple threshold
 values are passed, check_pgactivity will choose the largest (bloat size) value.
 
 This service supports argument a \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ parameter to exclude relations matching
 the regular expression. The regexps apply on
 "schema_name.relation_name". You can use multiple \ ``--exclude REGEX``\ parameters.
 
 **Warning**: With a non-superuser role, only tables the role is granted
 access to are checked!
 
 Perfdata will return the number of tables of concern, by warning and critical
 threshold per database.
